    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked mac and cheese starts with cooked elbow macaroni pasta, which serves as the foundation of the dish. The pasta is cooked until just tender, then combined with a luscious cheese sauce, creating a harmonious blend of textures and flavors.

        The cheese sauce is the heart of this dish, providing a velvety and creamy consistency that coats each pasta piece. Typically, the sauce is made by melting butter in a saucepan, then whisking in flour to create a roux. Milk is gradually added to the roux, creating a smooth base. Generous amounts of shredded cheese, often a combination of cheddar for its sharpness and meltability, along with other varieties like Gruyère or Monterey Jack, are added to the sauce. As the cheese melts, it infuses the sauce with its rich and tangy flavor, resulting in a sauce that is both creamy and deeply flavorful.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Elbow macaroni (2 cups)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese (2 cups)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook Macaroni</strong>: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cook the elbow macaroni in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Cheese Sauce</strong>: In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to create a roux and cook for 1-2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring no lumps form. Cook the sauce until it thickens, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cheese</strong>: Stir in 1½ cups of shredded cheddar cheese into the sauce until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Transfer</strong>: Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, stirring until the pasta is well coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top.</li>
