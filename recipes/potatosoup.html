    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A loaded baked potato begins with a perfectly baked russet potato, which has a crispy skin on the outside and a fluffy, tender interior. The potato is typically baked in the oven until the skin becomes golden and the inside is soft and pillowy.
    Once baked, the potato is sliced open, creating a pocket ready to be filled with a variety of delicious toppings. The "loaded" aspect refers to the generous and customizable assortment of ingredients that adorn the potato, creating a flavorful and satisfying dish.</p>
