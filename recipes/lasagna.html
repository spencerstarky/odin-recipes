    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a layered pasta dish that traditionally consists of wide, flat lasagna noodles alternated with various fillings and sauces. The base layers often start with a rich, savory tomato-based meat sauce, commonly made with ground beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs such as basil, oregano, and thyme. Each layer of noodles is separated by this flavorful sauce, providing a balance of texture and taste.</p>
